# Farkle Dice Game


Farkle is a 2-player game, the first one to reach 100 points wins. Players take turns rolling a dice and storing their cumulative points. They can either hold the points of the current round by adding it to their cumulative total and pass the dice to the opposition or they score a 1 and all their current round points get erased and the opponent gets the dice.
